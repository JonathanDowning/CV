### An iOS, macOS, and watchOS Developer

I’m Jonathan Downing, an iOS developer with a passion for solving complex problems in a simple, user-centric way.
I work best in teams that promote learning over knowing, and on projects that have a clear purpose and ability to impact society in a meaningful way. Outside of work I enjoy participating in tech networking events such as the [Intertech Diversity Forum](https://www.facebook.com/intertechlgbt), as well as flying light aircraft with friends and family as a Private Pilot.

## What I Know Best
- My true strength and passion is developing iPhone, iPad, and macOS applications using **Swift** and **Objective-C**. I have 5 years worth of experience with this platform and those languages, 3 of which have been in professional environments.
- Use of **Xcode** with dependency managers such as [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org), [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), and [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager).
- Respecting the importance of **readable and maintainable code** for humans, using clear method and variable names, commenting effectively, and designing for testability.
- **Source Code Management** using Git. Project management using GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and Milestones.
- **Continuous Integration** using tools such as [Buddybuild](https://www.buddybuild.com) and [Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io).
- **Web standards**, including OAuth, JWT, and the design, implementation, and consumption fo REST APIs.

## Work Accomplishments
#### **Software Engineer**, [Ultra Horizon](https://ultra-horizon.com), *July 2017 – Present*

- Developed [UH Net](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uh-net/id1257116295?platform=iphone&preserveScrollPosition=true#platform/iphone), in collaboration with a designer and project manager, for both iOS and macOS from empty projects to App Store submission.
- Learned and adopted [StoreKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit) and [NetworkExtension](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension), two Apple frameworks with which I had no prior experience.
- Implemented a server-side receipt validation service, in Python, to verify in-app purchases securely.
- Personally set up a continuous integration system (based on [Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io)) to automate unit/UI tests, beta testing, and App Store submission.

#### **Software Engineer**, [GWS Media](https://www.gwsmedia.com), *September 2016 – July 2017*

The code and infrastructure was iOS 5 era and required major updates to feel at home on iOS 7.  
- Spearheaded the adoption of software engineering best practices within the iOS team, such as utilising source code management, dependency managers, and unit testing.
